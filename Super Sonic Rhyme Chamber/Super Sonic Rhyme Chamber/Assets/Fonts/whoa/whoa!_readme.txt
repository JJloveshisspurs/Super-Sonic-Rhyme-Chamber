This is a freeware graffiti-inspired decorative font.
If you want to use this font commercially, please contact me by e-mail; johanw82@gmail.com
I prefer a high point-size when using this font (72 points or higher).
The font only has lower case characters, so make sure capslock isn´t on when using it.
Feel free to distribute this font, or any other one of my fonts. Do not sell them though.

Have fun!
